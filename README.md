# Titanic-ML-Competition
Titanic Competition is one the most popular data science challenge on Kaggle platform:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
The goal of the challenge is simple: predict which people survived the Titanic disaster.

* Of course, the Titanic dataset is an open dataset which you can reach on many repositories and websites. However, I used dataset from Kaggle. Also, Kaggle easily measure the accuracy of your predictions. 

In this competition, you obtain two similar datasets: `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

1. `train.csv` contains the details of a subset of the 891 passengers on board and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not.
2. `test.csv` dataset contains similar data for another 418 passengers but does not have survival information - itâ€™s your job to predict these outcomes.

The training set is used to build a machine learning model, while test dataset is used to see how high is the accuracy of created model.
Kaggle also includes `gender_submission.csv`, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.


Variables in dataset with definition:
* PassengerId - unique ID
* Survived - Survival -> 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Pclass - Ticket Class -> 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
* Name - Name and Title of a passenger
* Sex - Sex of a Passenger
* Age - Age of a Passenger
* SibSp - Number of Passenger's Siblings/Spouses aboard
* Parch - Number of Passenger's Parents/Children aboard
* Ticket - Tictek number    
* Fare - Passenger fare
* Cabin - Cabin number
* Embarked - Port of Embarkation -> C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
